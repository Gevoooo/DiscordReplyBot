# DiscordReplyBot

Using Discord.py, the Discord-Reply-Bot scans all new messages across all chats, and as soon as someone mentions the specific string it is detecting, it has a chance of outputting a random reply from a list. The specific string, chance %, and list, can all be changed.

Has commands for adding/deleting quotes straight from chat and commands for adding admins who have access commands that all members would otherwise not have.
