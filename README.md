# DiscordReplyBot

This project started as a joke between friends asking for a bot that mocks one of our buddies, so this is a generalized copy of it.

Using Discord.py, the Discord-Reply-Bot scans all new messages across all chats, and as soon as someone mentions the specific string it is detecting, it has a chance of outputting a random reply from a list. The specific string, chance %, and list, can all be changed.
